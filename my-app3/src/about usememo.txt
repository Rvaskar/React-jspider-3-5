Case 1
Scenario: You pass the same count value (count = 4) back-to-back.
Answer: Yes, useMemo will reuse the memoized value.
Reason: If the dependency array ([count]) hasn't changed, useMemo will return the previously memoized value without recalculating the function. Passing the same count back-to-back ensures the function is not re-executed.
Case 2
Scenario: You pass different count values sequentially (count = 3, count = 5, count = 6). Then, you pass a previously used value (count = 3 or count = 5).
Answer: No, useMemo will not reuse the earlier value.
Reason: useMemo only retains the most recent computed value and does not keep a history of previous values. When count changes, useMemo recalculates the value. Even if you reuse a previously passed value (like count = 3), it will re-execute the function instead of fetching the earlier result.
Case 3
Scenario: You pass the same count value after three or four other values have been passed.
Answer: No, useMemo does not remember old values.
Reason: useMemo does not store a cache of multiple previous computations. It only retains the most recent memoized value based on the dependency array. Once count changes, the previous memoized value is discarded, and useMemo re-executes the function for the new value.
Key Takeaways
useMemo only retains the most recent computed value based on the dependencies.
If the dependency value is the same as the previous render, useMemo uses the memoized value.
It does not maintain a history of all previously computed values.
Recomputations happen for any new value, even if it was previously passed.
